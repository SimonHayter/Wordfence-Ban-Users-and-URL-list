# Ensure you review the URLs before pasting into WordFence. URLs are added by comma or by seperate lines.
# When blocking by URL it is extremely important not to go overboard. Googlebot checks your site for malware, and will regularly attempt URLS that do not exist, they check the same bad URLS that bad bots do. If the URL doesn't exist 404 is the proper server return. You can throttle these users, or just leave them to it.
